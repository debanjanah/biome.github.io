			Natural Dyer:
			Since everything starts at the source, we want to take up the project to travel to places where authentic non polluting natural dyeing is happening and document it, interview the people behind it, understand their story and history, know about
			impact on their water, environment, know about their dyes, connect to the intentions and find out the challenges and gaps. This information would be converted to a module that will be shared with designers and buying houses of fabrics that see
			natural dyed fabrics as just another fabric because we know that the language is a unique one and needs to be communicated with ease and clarity.
			The sources will be chosen on the criteria of their being open to share and make such fabrics available and affordable. This is not a theoretical or intellectual or research exercise. This is finding live wires and connecting them to the light up
			the minds of anyone and everyone who wants to know. We are grateful to them for continuing a sustainable process that protects our water, land and air.
			If you know any such natural dyer, community or organization or company, do connect us to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			User:
			We see users as two kinds. One is a maker that uses natural dyes/yarns/fabric to make and other is a direct user who consumes. ‘Maker’ can be a designer, a fashion house, a company dedicated to sustainability, an individual, artist who want to
			use natural colors/dyes in their work and have not been able to do so because of gaps in understanding or finding right sources. We understand that this user is driven by fashion trends, forecasts, market dynamics and consumer demand. However we
			also realize that this person has freedom to exercise what he /she will use as a medium, and the creativity to turn it into an aesthetic.
			The other is the user who buys/wears clothing. This is the person that makes a choice to endorse a certain kind of clothing and fashion and drives the designer to a certain extent. However this user is being driven by media, films, fashion,
			peers, society and knowledge of what he/she understands about clothes. Life is such that basic things like food and clothes are always taken for granted. However what if this user knows that he/she can make an informed choice, that he/she can
			make a difference in the canvas of pollution and environmental degradation.
			If you want to support this movement, you may buy the products of the listed natural dyed brands. You can donate any resource that you may, to our pool. You may connect other users and makers/ designers who will be interested to know this and who
			can support us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nature
			We live in it, off it and yet mostly we are disconnected with it.This entity is hardly acknowledged amidst our small and big issues and problems. We are getting busier by the day, getting locked in our little screens and individual fragmented
			lives. Some of us are re-connecting to our umbilical chord connection with Nature, re-imagining our future, unlearning in the present, taking a detour, living a sustainable life and so on. Hence to bring Nature into the forefront, setting up
			gentle connecting sessions, encounters and initiation for anyone who is willing. We would want to take up awareness sessions/ workshops/ artistic collaborations in cities we cross or come across while documenting the source. The idea is to do
			this completely with community help, barter system and in the spirit of gift culture.
			You can host us when we are on a documenting tour. You can organize a session at your place to have a light interaction on how we are inter-connected to Nature and each other.

			Along with this, we would brainstorm and work out a unique marketing, branding and communication tool book that can be used by any sustainable company or individual to reach out to people.
			You can contribute by becoming a chain of humans that will consciously spread the word about natural dyeing humans and their brands/ oragnsiations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Who will support and nourish the Project?
			You, and many others like you, who are intelligent, understand basic common sense that we must take care of what sustains us,
			someone who has found himself or herself and is ready to understand the interconnectedness of our life with Nature and each other.

			This project work is what it is worth. We have no inclination to register this into an organization or company. The idea is NOT FOR PROFIT. It must be sustained and nourished with love from people in any way they can. We ask for help as and when
			we need. We keep making this family stronger. We do not decide how big or small it should be. We do not decide who is ethical, who is not. We find out when we document them. All will be factual, not emotional. It will be about experience and not
			just knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			However the direct beneficiaries will be natural dyers, companies, organizations, designers and textile houses that are making, selling or using natural dyes or natural dyed yarns, fabrics, garments etc. At the core, it is for every human who
			lives on this planet as it’s about sustaining what sustains us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Do you have questions? Is it a yes? Our eyes are gleaming with excitement at this point!
