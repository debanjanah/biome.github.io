			<h1>Biome is a living dream towards a sustainable future.</h1>
		</div>
		<p>
			Biome is the answer of how a consumer product like clothing becomes sustainable to our natural environment that sustains us in the first place.
		</p>
		<p>The simple truth is that our choices in clothes are interconnected to<br>
			<ul>
				<li>· the person who makes our textile</li>
				<li>· the process of how it is made</li>
				<li>· the way it is sold, to the way it is used</li>
				<li>· with the way it is going to be disposed</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			We understand that the textiles industry is one of the biggest polluting industries.
			A two metre fabric in it's life uses 8000 chemicals that impacts human body as well as the environment.<br>
			It pollutes 2000 litres of fresh water that cannot be used for any other purpose.
		</p>
			<p>
				The dyeing part of the process is a major culprit where maximum harmful chemicals are used. Hence the need to appreciate and apply natural dyes on fabrics is a sustainable solution in the long run. Natural dyeing would cause no air, water or
				soil
				pollution and no harm to human skin as these are all Ayurvedic and medicinal herbs. In India natural dyeing was our legacy and we have history of unique processes in every part of our country. Many eco friendly companies and organisations claim
				LOW IMPACT DYES, but they do affect the environment and the human body. We need to adopt a no-impact dyeing because we are trying to maintain the natural life cycle.
			</p>
			<p>
				At Biome, we sell natural dyed fabrics and garments under the name of 'Biome Conscious Fashion' and we conduct natural dye workshops for children, adults and hold awareness seminars under the name of 'Biome Project'.
			</p>
			<h3>About the Fabric we use:</h3>
			<p>
				100% Organic Fabric + HERBAL DYED = 100% organic herbal dyed Fabric. <br>
			Handwoven fabrics + natural dyes = 100% sustainable and natural fabric.
		</p>
				<p>
					Herbal and natural Dyeing = Dyeing technique where in only 100% Bio-degradable herb, Plant, minerals, fruits, vegetables etc. are used to dye, print, process and finish.
				</p>
				<h3>About our style:</h3>
				<p>
					The designs are very clean cuts that define the need for simplicity in life that is getting cluttered with fast fashion consumerism. They embrace the body shape and the colors are very soothing to human eyes.

							<h3>About our Founder:</h3>
							<p>
								“I like to think, to question, this makes me act I am, so I do. I love clothes but not the indulgence into it"
								My journey started organically because chemical free natural dyed textiles inspired me to create and offer as an experience. One lesson that Nature teaches is that everything in the world is connected to other things. And hence the process of
								making fabrics was very intriguing for me to understand. That led me to the dyeing part of the work and its impact on the environment. I had always been designing clothes for myself and i extended it to others when it came to selling natural
								dyed fabrics. My design sensibility and aesthetics helped me bridge the gap to reach people with what had touched me. The struggle was to convey the wash- care instructions and to explain why there are limited shades and patterns.
								However i saw the gap in awareness and spontaneously addressed it by holding natural dyeing workshops with 7 year olds to adults of any age. People started having fun and started experiencing a wholesome understanding. Working with children has
								been most satisfactory as they are able to exercise common sense over fear and prejudices.
